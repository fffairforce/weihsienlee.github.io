My name is Wei-Hsien (Willy) Lee, a bioengineer with a Ph.D. in Bioengineering from University of Kansas, where my research focused on decoding the neural dynamics underlying precision motor control. My work lies at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and real-time systems engineering. I’ve developed closed-loop brain-computer interface (BCI) systems that integrate real-time neural signal processing, behavioral control hardware, and deep learning algorithms to study how the brain encodes and executes movement.
With expertise in BCI paradigm design, firmware development, and neural decoding using Python, MATLAB, and deep learning frameworks, I focus on understanding how neural dynamics encode precise movement. I’m passionate about translating this work into real-world applications—from neuroprosthetics to next-generation neural interfaces—and am committed to advancing robust, scalable BCI solutions in industry.
